== CONDITIONS ==================================================================

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

&COND.ADDICTED [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Addicted|1|

	Your character is addicted to something, whether drugs, gambling or other 
	destructive behaviors. Some addictions are more dangerous than others, but 
	the nature of addiction is that it slowly takes over your life, impeding 
	functionality. If you are addicted, you need to indulge your addiction 
	regularly to keep it under control.%r%rA specific addiction should be chosen 
	upon taking this Condition; characters can take this Condition multiple 
	times for different addiction. Being unable to feed your addiction can 
	result in the Deprived Condition.|
	
	<sources>|

	Regain a dot of Integrity or Wisdom, lose another dot of Integrity or 
	Wisdom, or achieve an exceptional success on a breaking point or Act of 
	Hubris.|

	Your character chooses to get a fix rather than fulfill an obligation.|

	MtA.314

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

&COND.CHARMED [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Charmed|0|

	Your character enjoys the protection of magical good fortune. This may spare 
	her from serious injury, ensure that she meets someone whose acquaintance 
	will be valuable to her later, guarantee that she isn't the one who gets the 
	short straw, or help her win an important game of chance. You may invoke 
	this twist of fate at any time as a reflexive action. If used to avoid 
	injury, resolving this Condition reduces the damage to 1. Otherwise, neither 
	you nor the mage knows the exact nature this good fortune will take when it 
	manifests--only that it will have a significant impact.|
	
	This is commonly the effect of a boon granted by Fate magic.|

	Your character narrowly avoids some misfortune or enjoys a lucky break; the 
	Condition is resolved as described above.|

	n/a|

	MtA.315

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

&COND.DEFEATED [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Defeated|0|

	Your character has been beaten in the Duel Arcane, humiliated, and made 
	completely open and exposed to an enemy. For the duration of this Condition, 
	the character cannot spend Willpower or use magic in any way to harm the 
	mage she was defeated by. Further, the mage who won the Duel has Strong 
	sympathy with the loser.|
	
	Defeated in the Duel Arcane|
	
	This Condition lingers until the character can greatly humble himself in 
	public at great personal cost, or until the winner of the Duel takes 
	advantage of the sympathy in a way that injures or abuses the loser. Take a 
	Beat.|
	
	Take a Beat whenever your character is abused or humiliated as a result of 
	her defeat.|

	MtA.315

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

&COND.DISABLED [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Disabled|1|

	Your character has limited or no ability to walk. Her Speed trait is 
	effectively 1. She must rely on a wheelchair or other device to travel. A 
	manual wheelchair's Speed is equal to your character's Strength and requires 
	use of her hands. Electric wheelchairs have a Speed of 3, but allow the free 
	use of the character's hands. An injury can cause this Condition 
	temporarily, in which case it is resolved when the injury heals and the 
	character regains mobility.|

	|

	The character's disability is cured by mundane or supernatural means.|
	
	Your character's limited mobility inconveniences your character and makes 
	her slow to respond.|

	MtA.315

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

&COND.ENERVATED [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Enervated|1|

	The character is in the second stage of soul loss. Her instinctive efforts 
	to shore up her Willpower by giving into her urges have failed, her 
	Integrity has gone, and her Willpower is now fading. In addition to the 
	effects of Soulless, she can no longer regain Willpower through her Virtue, 
	only her Vice. Indulging herself brings diminishing returns--whenever she 
	does so, her permanent Willpower drops by one dot before she regains 
	Willpower points to the new maximum.%r%r
	Mages lose a dot of Gnosis every time their Willpower drops, to a minimum of 
	0.|

	|

	This Condition is only removed if the character regains her soul.|

	You lose a dot of Willpower|

	MtA.315-6

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

&COND.HUMBLED [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Humbled|0|

	You have been reminded of the power of humanity, and your arrogance and 
	pride crumble away. Any symbol or person that triggered this feeling in you 
	creates a feeling of admiration that you are highly protective of. You 
	cannot bring yourself to harm the source of your humbling, and treat it or 
	him as a source of great wisdom and solace.|

	Extreme sacrifice on your behalf. Certain Sleepwalker Merits.|

	The character sacrifices of himself in dramatic fashion in the name of the 
	person or symbol that humbled him in the first place.|

	Any time the character might act with hubris or arrogance, if the player 
	chooses to take a dramatic failure on that roll rather attempt it, take a 
	Beat.|

	MtA.316

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

&COND.MEGALOMANIACAL [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Megalomaniacal|0|

	Your character is consumed by her own aptitude. She sees greatness in her 
	every action, and that sense of greatness breeds righteousness. She cannot 
	see her behavior as hubris, and she refuses to acknowledge any failings. 
	After all, she's mastered the forces of the universe, right?%r%r

	Your character automatically fails any actions using the Empathy Skill. As 
	well, she gains an additional "Selfish" Vice and a "Dominate Others" 
	Obsession that replaces one of her current Obsessions so long as she 
	maintains this Condition.|

	|

	Hurt someone important to you in such a way that it risks further Wisdom 
	loss.|

	n/a|

	MtA.317

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

&COND.MYSTERY_COMMANDS [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Mystery Commands|1|

	Your character hears the voice of the Exarchs, sees their words scrawled in 
	her mind, and otherwise receives commands from deep within her Oneiros. Her 
	Exarch's will becomes an additional Obsession, with all according benefits.

	The Storyteller will occasionally give commands as part of this Merit. 
	Additionally, your character can take actions in the name of her Exarch and 
	reverse-engineer messages out of the context. Most any action that aligns 
	with her Exarch's basic whims should apply to this Condition.|

	|

	Your character cuts off ties to her Exarch. Traitors are not tolerated, and 
	other characters with this Condition will be sent to punish her, or kill her 
	if she will not return to the Throne's service.|

	(Arcane) Your character faces meaningful setback, danger, or sacrifice on 
	account of the commands.|

	MtA.317

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

&COND.RAMPANT [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Rampant|0|

	Your character is reckless and forceful with her magic. She will not 
	hesitate to use it to solve any minor problem. If your character has a 
	reasonable magical solution to a problem, to use a mundane solution requires 
	a point of Willpower. This Willpower does not add to the dice roll. As well, 
	she gains a "Wield Magic Indiscriminately" Obsession that replaces one of 
	her current Obsessions so long as she maintains this Condition.|

	<sources>|

	Suffer a Paradox.|

	n/a|

	MtA.317

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

&COND.STRAINED [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Strained|0|

	Your character has narrowly avoided Integrity loss due to witnessing magic. 
	Take -1 to resist the next time you suffer a breaking point and must roll. 
	If you have the Strained Merit, you may opt to not roll, and the Condition 
	will build: each consecutive time you avoid rolling a breaking point 
	contributes an additional -1 to your next breaking point roll, to a maximum 
	of -5. After -5, you can no longer push the horror away, your character 
	snaps, and you automatically roll for the breaking point at -5.|

	Narrowly avoided Integrity loss due to witnessing magic|

	The character suffers Integrity loss. Take an additional Beat atop that of 
	the breaking point.|

	n/a|

	MtA.318

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

&COND.SOULLESS [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Soulless|1|

	he character is in the first stage of soul loss. Without a soul, she is more 
	susceptible to possession--any dice pools to resist being taken over or 
	possessed by another entity are at a -2 die penalty. The effects on Wisdom 
	and Willpower, though, are more severe. For as long as she has this 
	Condition, she does not regain Willpower through surrender or rest, and her 
	use of Virtue and Vice is reversed. She may regain one Willpower point per 
	scene by fulfilling her Virtue without having to risk herself, and regains 
	full Willpower once per chapter by fulfilling her Vice in a way that poses a 
	threat to herself.%r%r

	Regaining Willpower through Vice, though, is now a breaking point against 
	Integrity with a -5 penalty unless the character has reached Integrity 1, or 
	an Act of Hubris (roll 1 die) unless she has reached Wisdom 1 for mages.|

	|

	Resolution: Regain a soul.|

	Beat: You lose Wisdom or Integrity because you indulged your Vice.|

	MtA.318

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

&COND.SOUL_SHOCKED [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Soul Shocked|0|

	Your character has been killed while on a sojourn outside her physical body, 
	resulting in a shocked sense of self. Upon gaining this Condition, roll her 
	current Willpower points (not dots) as a dice pool. Ignore 10-Again on this 
	roll, and do not roll a chance die if she has no Willpower left. She keeps 
	one Willpower point per success, and immediately loses the remainder. While 
	this Condition is in effect, your character does not regain Willpower from 
	Virtue, Vice, or equivalent traits. She still regains Willpower from rest, 
	surrender, and any other means of regaining Willpower.|

	Killed outside her physical body| 

	Regain full Willpower|

	Beat: n/a|

	MtA.318

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Also in Vampire! *** Check! ***

&COND.THRALL [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Thrall|1|

	The character has fully succumbed to the effects of soullessness. She may 
	not spend Willpower points for any reason, may not use her Defense in 
	combat, may not spend Experiences, and suffers all the effects of the Broken 
	Condition as well. Mages can no longer cast spells. The player should only 
	continue playing a character with this Condition if she stands a chance of 
	regaining a soul.|

	Soul loss.|

	Regain a soul.|

	Gain a Beat whenever the character is victimized as a result of her 
	Condition.|

	MtA.318

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

&COND.TRIUMPHANT [v( d.ctdb )]=

	Triumphant|0|

	Desc: The character has won a Duel Arcane and her triumph radiates through 
	her Nimbus for any Awakened to sense. Until the Condition is resolved, the 
	character gets an exceptional success on three successes rather than five on 
	any Social rolls with anyone in Awakened society aware of the victory.|

	Won a Duel Arcane|

	The first time you fail a Social roll with a member of Awakened society, 
	take a Beat, and the Condition ends.|

	Gain a Beat any time you throw your success in someone's face, even if it 
	risks making him angry or esentful.|

	MtA.318

*/

&TILT.POOR_LIGHT [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Poor Light|0|

	(Environmental) Dim illumination, strobes, or flickering lights make it 
	difficult to track movement and see clearly.%r%r

	Effect: Affected characters suffer a -2 penalty to visual-based Perception 
	rolls, including ranged combat, rising to -3 at medium range and -4 at long 
	range.|

	This Tilt applies to scenes of "natural" darkness with dim ambient light, 
	such as the outdoors at night away from urban light pollution, and to 
	disconcerting environments like a nightclub with its effects system on.|

	Bring, find, or create a light source.|
