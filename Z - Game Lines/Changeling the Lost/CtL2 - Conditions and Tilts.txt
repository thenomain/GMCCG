## CHANGELING CONDITIONS & TILTS ###############################################

Goes along with 9a Conditions and Tilts

As a changeling takes damage to her three rightmost Clarity boxes, she gains 
Conditions--Persistent Conditions if the damage was severe. She gains one 
Clarity Condition for any amount of mild damage in these boxes, or one 
Persistent Condition for any amount of severe damage in the same. The 
Storyteller decides which Condition the character takes, though it should be 
germane to the situation that caused the damage.

Whenever a character resolves any Clarity Condition, she heals one point of 
Clarity damage; whenever she resolves any Persistent Clarity Condition, she 
heals two instead.

The following Conditions could result from Clarity damage:
• Numb (Persistent)
• Shaken
• Sleepwalking (Persistent)
• Spooked
• Withdrawn
For more information on these Conditions, see the
Appendix starting on p. 333.

@fo me=&COND.ARCADIAN_DREAMS [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Arcadian Dreams|1|
	
	Until her promise-bound is safely out of Arcadia, the fae-touched is plagued 
	with dreams and visions of him. She always has an awareness of him in the 
	back of her mind. If she is in the Hedge, she has a general knowledge of 
	what direction to travel in to reach him and gains a one-die bonus to 
	navigate the Hedge toward him. She can feel his pain as though it were her 
	own.|

	All Fae-touched|

	The Avowed reunites with her promise-bound, or he dies before that can 
	happen, in which case she knows about it immediately. The latter constitutes 
	a breaking point for the fae-touched character.|

	The player chooses to fail any roll. These failures occur due to sudden, 
	distracting suffering by proxy, or due to a poignant reminder of one of her 
	visions in the current situation, which the player can come up with on the 
	fly.|
	
	CtL.333

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------	

@fo me=&COND.BERSERK [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Berserk|0|
	
	Your character has a spark of berserk rage lit within her. The fury inside 
	demands that she lash out, and the descending red mist makes it hard to tell 
	friend from foe. Each turn, she must succeed at a Resolve + Composure roll 
	or attack the nearest target with whatever weapons she has to hand. Even if 
	she succeeds, she suffers a -3 penalty on all actions other than attacking 
	the nearest target.\%r\%r
	Changelings with this Condition add one die to Clarity damage rolls.|
	
	Some supernatural powers.|
	
	The character becomes unconscious or there are no targets left to attack.|
	
	n/a|
	
	CtL.333-4


// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------	

@fo me=&COND.COMATOSE [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Comatose|0|
	
	Your character has reached rock bottom. She has lost any ability to 
	distinguish reality from fantasy, and has gone into a deep dream. She 
	believes she is awake, living her life perfectly normally, but is instead 
	lying in a coma. She cannot roll to enter the Gate of Ivory (p. 215) or 
	dream lucidly without help. If this Condition came about through mild 
	Clarity damage, events in her dream may lead her to resolve another Clarity 
	Condition even though she doesn't realize she's dreaming, allowing her to 
	wake up.|

	Reaching Clarity 0 With Mild Damage|
	
	The character regains Clarity, or she realizes she is in a dream and 
	awakens, regaining a point of Clarity as normal.|

	n/a|
	CtL.334

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------	

@fo me=&COND.PERSISTENT_COMATOSE [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Persistent Comatose|1|
	
	Your character has reached rock bottom. She has lost any ability to 
	distinguish reality from fantasy, and has gone into a deep dream. She 
	believes she is awake, living her life perfectly normally, but is instead 
	lying in a coma. She cannot roll to enter the Gate of Ivory (p. 215) or 
	dream lucidly without help. If this Condition came about through severe 
	Clarity damage, events in her dream may lead her to resolve another Clarity 
	Condition even though she doesn't realize she's dreaming, but this doesn't 
	wake her. If someone can convince her that she's actually dreaming, through 
	oneiromancy or some other method, she can claw her way back to wakefulness.|

	Reaching Clarity 0 With Severe Damage|
	
	The character is convinced she is in a dream and awakens, which requires 
	someone to come and rescue her. Any other Clarity Conditions she may have 
	resolved during this time increase her Clarity as normal, but do not resolve 
	this Condition.|

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------	

@fo me=&COND.DEMORALIZED [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Demoralized|0|

	Your character is demoralized and hesitant in the face of the enemy. 
	Spending a Willpower point only adds one die to her pool for attacks instead 
	of the usual three. She also suffers a -4 penalty to her Initiative, and a 
	-2 penalty to her Resolve and Composure whenever used to resist or contest a 
	dice pool.\%r\%rIf this Condition doesn't resolve within a week, it 
	fades.\%r\%rChangelings with this Condition add one die to Clarity damage 
	rolls.|
	
	Dramatic failure|
	
	Achieve exceptional success on an attack roll, win a fight, or survive 
	a fight unharmed.|
	
	none|
	CtL.335

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------	

@fo me=&COND.DISORIENTED [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Disoriented|0|

	Your character cannot get her bearings and dealing with simple tasks is 
	daunting. The character is at a -2 penalty to any Physical action. She can 
	defend herself normally, but her disorientation prevents her from making 
	ranged attacks at all.\%r\%r
	Changelings with this Condition add one die to Clarity damage rolls.|

	Some supernatural powers, blunt physical trauma|
	
	The character finds something to help her orient herself to her 
	surroundings, such as a familiar landmark or a friend. If a supernatural 
	power caused this Condition, then it resolves when the power ends.|
	
	n/a|
	
	CtL.336
	
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------	

@fo me=&COND.DISSOCIATION [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Dissociation|0|
	
	Your character questions whether she is even real. She experiences episodes 
	where she feels like a passenger in someone else's body, unable to control 
	her own thoughts or actions. Sometimes she goes long hours simply watching 
	herself, wondering how much of what she sees is real, and how much is memory 
	of her time in Arcadia. Any time the character has a chance to break with 
	the mundane, such as using a Contract, you can opt to fail the roll to 
	affirm that she's in the real world and resolve this Condition.|
	
	Mild Clarity damage in any of your three rightmost boxes, 
	some dramatic failures|
	
	The player chooses to fail a roll as described above.|

@fo me=&COND.DISTRACTED [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Distracted|0|
	
	Constant confusion and distractions buffet your character from all sides. 
	She cannot take extended actions, and suffers a –2 die penalty to all 
	rolls involving perception, concentration, and precision.|
	
	Being in a highly confusing environment, mild Clarity damage in any of 
	your three rightmost boxes|
	
	Leaving the environment\\; if inflicted by Clarity damage, regaining all

@fo me=&COND.DREAM_ASSAILANT [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Dream Assailant|0|

	Your character has caused too many significant shifts to the dreamscape, and 
	the eidolons are now actively hostile to you. You take a -5 to any roll to 
	interact with them peacefully or do anything unnoticed, and all failures 
	that involve eidolons your character isn't fighting are dramatic failures. 
	Reduce all eidolon impressions of you to Hostile for Social maneuvering. All 
	paradigm shifts cost two additional successes to enact, and you can't enact 
	subtle shifts at all.\%r\%rIf you resolve this Condition by interacting with 
	an important eidolon or prop, choose one of the following effects to impose 
	on the dreamer or any effect from a milder Shift Condition, which persists 
	after he wakes:\%r
	\%b * Leave subliminal Manipulation clues as Dream Infiltrator, but roll 
	Wits + Empathy + Wyrd instead.\%r
	\%b * Inflict the Ravaged Condition (p. 344).\%r
	\%b * Inflict the Flesh Too Solid Tilt (p. 329) on the dreamer's dream 
	form.|

	Enact a paradigm shift in a dream|

	Exit the dream and don't return for one week\\; reintegrate yourself into 
	the dream by taking a number of meaningful actions equal to the dreamer's 
	Resolve without making any shifts to downgrade this Condition to Dream 
	Intruder\\; or succeed at a meaningful action to influence an important 
	eidolon (or the subject's dream self) or use an important prop in a way 
	that's directly related to the waking change you want to make. Only relevant 
	eidolons and props count, subject to Storyteller discretion.|

@fo me=&COND.DREAM_INFILTRATOR [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Dream Infiltrator|0|

	Your character has caused a significant shift to the dreamscape, and the 
	eidolons are now suspicious of you. You take a -2 to any roll to interact 
	with them peacefully, or a -3 to do anything unnoticed. Reduce all eidolon 
	impressions of you by one for Social maneuvering. All subtle shifts cost one 
	additional success to enact.\%r\%rIf you resolve this Condition by 
	interacting with an important eidolon or prop, choose one of the following 
	effects to impose on the dreamer, which persists after he wakes:\%r
	\%b * Deliver a subliminal message\\; he will remember the information but 
	not where it came from.\%r
	\%b * Make a Wits roll and "store" successes as dice in the subject's mind, 
	for use as bonus dice on Manipulation-based rolls you make against him 
	within the next chapter as you take advantage of subliminal clues you left 
	behind.\%r
	\%b * Impose or remove a Condition that changes the dreamer's attitude 
	toward your character or another, or behavior in general: e.g. Swooned, 
	Leveraged, Competitive, Paranoid, etc.\\; resolving a Condition this way 
	grants Beats as normal.\%r
	\%b * Increase or decrease the Fortification rating of the dreamer's Bastion 
	by 1 for the rest of the story.\%r
	\%b Increase or decrease the dreamer's impression of you or another 
	character by two levels on the chart for Social maneuvering (p. 192)\%r
	\%b * Open Doors equal to your character's Empathy for Social maneuvering 
	against the dreamer toward a particular goal.\%r
	\%b * Stop the dreamer from recovering Willpower during this night's rest|
	
	Enact a paradigm shift in a dream|
	
	Upgrade this Condition to another Shift Condition\\; exit the dream and 
	don't return until the dreamer wakes and sleeps again\\; reintegrate 
	yourself into the dream by taking a number of meaningful actions equal to 
	the dreamer's Resolve without making any shifts\\; or succeed at a 
	meaningful action to influence an important eidolon (or the subject's dream 
	self) or use an important prop in a way that's directly related to the 
	waking change you want to make. Only relevant eidolons and props count, 
	subject to Storyteller discretion.|

	CtL.337-8

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------	

@fo me=&COND.DREAM_INTRUDER [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Dream Intruder|0|

	Your character has caused multiple significant shifts to the dreamscape, and 
	the eidolons are now uncomfortable with your presence. You take a -3 to any 
	roll to interact with them peacefully, or a -4 to do anything unnoticed, and 
	all failures that involve eidolons your character isn't fighting are 
	dramatic failures. Reduce all eidolon impressions of you by two for Social 
	maneuvering. All subtle shifts and paradigm shifts cost one additional 
	success to enact.\%r\%rIf you resolve this Condition by interacting with an 
	important eidolon or prop, choose one of the following effects to impose on 
	the dreamer or any effect from Dream Infiltrator, which persists after he 
	wakes:\%r
	\%b * Deliver a subliminal suggestion\\; he will perform one specific action 
	of your choice within 24 hours of waking, as long as it wouldn't cause him 
	to suffer a breaking point.\%r
	\%b * Leave subliminal Manipulation clues as Dream Infiltrator, but roll 
	Wits + Empathy instead.\%r
	\%b * Impose or remove one Persistent Condition that changes the dreamer's 
	mental state, behavior, or attitude toward someone or something: e.g. 
	Obsession, Awestruck, Amnesia, Madness, etc.\\; resolving a Condition this 
	way grant Beats as normal.\%r
	\%b * Make a Clarity attack against a changeling subject with a dice pool 
	equal to your character's Presence.\%r
	\%b * Reduce the subject's current Willpower or Glamour points by (your 
	Presence + Wyrd) and gain that many points yourself, up to your usual 
	maximum.\%r
	\%b * Increase or decrease one of the subject's Mental or Social Attributes 
	or Skills by 1 for the rest of the story.|

	Enact a paradigm shift in a dream|
	
	Upgrade this Condition to another Shift Condition\\; exit the dream and 
	don't return until the dreamer wakes and sleeps again twice\\; reintegrate 
	yourself into the dream by taking a number of meaningful actions equal to 
	the dreamer's Resolve without making any shifts to downgrade this Condition 
	to Dream Infiltrator\\; or succeed at a meaningful action to influence an 
	important eidolon (or the subject's dream self) or use an important prop in 
	a way that's directly related to the waking change you want to make. Only 
	relevant eidolons and props count, subject to Storyteller discretion.|

@fo me=&COND.FATIGUED [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Fatigued|0|

	Your character has never been so tired in all her life. Her eyelids are like 
	millstones, her brain a cobwebbed mass of exhaustion. She's reached that 
	point where fatigue becomes a physical thing, and all she can think to do is 
	close her eyes and rest, just for a moment. Every six hours, you must make a 
	reflexive Resolve + Stamina roll to remain awake. If you fail, your 
	character passes out. Even if you succeed, you suffer a cumulative -1 
	penalty to all dice pools (including rolls to stay awake). Long periods of 
	strenuous activity, like cross-country hiking, fighting, or heavy labor 
	increase the penalty to -2 or -3. Even then, a normal person can only go a 
	number of days without sleep equal to the lower of her Resolve or Stamina, 
	at which point she passes out. Once a Fatigued character passes out, she 
	remains asleep for eight hours plus one additional hour for every six-hour 
	period she stayed awake. Attempts to rouse her during this period suffer a 
	penalty equal to the highest penalty the Fatigued character suffered before 
	passing out.|
	
	 Staying awake for 24 hours, being dosed with a sedative or anesthetic, some 
	 supernatural powers|

	Sleeping, as described above, or the power ends.|

	CtL.338

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------	

@fo me=&COND.FRAGILE [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Fragile|0|

	The equipment the character is using to aid his action won't last long for 
	some reason, whether because it's an object put together with duct tape and 
	bubble gum, or because his relationship with the people involved sours, or 
	because his computer ends up suffering a blue screen of death and the data 
	is corrupted. A plan may be Fragile because of disrupted communication 
	between the characters, or because of an unexpected hurdle, etc. The 
	equipment ceases to exist in any usable form after a number of uses equal to 
	its creator's dots in the Skill used to build it.|

	Achieving a failure on a Build Equipment roll|
	
	The equipment falls apart one way or another. Plans grant one Beat to each 
	player whose character is involved when this Condition resolves.|

	n/a|
	
	CtL.339

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------	

@fo me=&COND.GLAMOUR_ADDICTED [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Glamour Addicted|1|
	
	Your character is addicted to Glamour. This slowly takes over her life, and 
	impedes functionality. She can go a number of days equal to her Resolve 
	before needing to obtain Glamour again. She must harvest or reap a number of 
	Glamour points equal to half her Wyrd (rounded up) during that period, or 
	suffer one lethal damage every day until she does and gain the Deprived 
	Condition (p. 335). This is incredibly painful as her body consumes its own 
	magical energy to satisfy the hunger for Glamour. The mask cracks, like a 
	fractured mirror in which each piece shows a different reflection of the fae 
	underneath. This special type of damage cannot be prevented or healed by any 
	means, nor can the character resolve the Deprived Condition, until the 
	changeling has supped upon Glamour once more.\%r\%r
	Add one die to Clarity damage rolls.|
	
	Harvesting Glamour every day for a week at Wyrd 6+|
	
	Achieve an exceptional success on a roll to harvest Glamour.|
	
	Your character takes damage from not being able to harvest Glamour.|
	
	CtL.339

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------	

@fo me=&COND.GOBLIN_QUEEN [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Goblin Queen|1|
	
	The character has risen far beyond ordinary goblins, and they scrape and bow 
	before her. This Condition functions as Hedge Denizen (p. 340), except as 
	follows:\%r
	\%b * The character's Mantle rejects her. She cannot invoke her current 
	Court Contracts, nor purchase new ones.\%r
	\%b * She gains the Status (Goblins) Merit at four dots. If the local Hedge 
	holds any creatures who outrank her, she immediately knows their assumed 
	names and titles.\%r
	\%b * The character's identity has so profoundly changed that fae beings no 
	longer add her Wyrd as bonus dice to track or find her. If she recovers her 
	Icon while she's a Goblin Queen, she can't reintegrate it into herself.\%r
	\%b * The Goblin Queen cannot leave the Hedge, except by wrapping pieces of 
	it as a mantle around her, to travel into the mortal realm or Arcadia for up 
	to a number of hours per day equal to her Wyrd. She still suffers the 
	Deprived Condition in the real world.\%r
	\%b * The Queen gains the Retainer Merit (p. 125) with dots equal to her 
	Wyrd, spread across as many individual Retainers as she likes up to a 
	maximum of five dots per Retainer. These retainers are all hobgoblins\\; see 
	p. 257 for examples. The retainers are unquestioningly loyal and devoted to 
	her.\%r
	\%b * Changelings with this Condition add two dice to Clarity damage rolls 
	instead of one.|

	Upgrade of Hedge Denizen|
	
	The Queen finds a human child and leaves him to take her place. The child 
	immediately gains the Goblin Queen Condition and all of her Retainers, who 
	protect him until he comes of age to ascend the throne. The child remembers 
	who abandoned him.\%r\%rThe character becomes what she once was again, 
	whether a changeling or otherwise. She takes on her old seeming, kith, and 
	identity--also setting the Fae back on her trail. If the character was 
	mortal previously, her player selects three dots of supernatural Merits for 
	her, as she is irrevocably changed. The newly abandoned queen can use the 
	same process to become human again as well. This resolution constitutes a 
	Clarity attack with two dice for changelings, or a breaking point for 
	others.\%r\%rAlternatively, if the character works off five points of Goblin 
	Debt, she resolves this Condition and regains the Hedge Denizen Condition 
	instead.|
	
	The character collects Goblin Debt from another character, selling a 
	Contract or making another kind of hobgoblin deal.|
	
	CtL.339-40

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------	

@fo me=&COND.HEDGE_ADDICTION [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Hedge Addiction|1|
	
	The Hedge draws the fae-touched character. If she is presented with an 
	opportunity to enter the Hedge, her player must succeed on a Resolve + 
	Composure roll to resist the temptation. The roll suffers a cumulative -1 
	penalty for each previous time the character has entered the Hedge during 
	this story, to a maximum of -1|

	Being fae-touched|

	The character refrains from entering the Hedge for a full story. However, 
	he regains this Condition if he ever does enter the Hedge in the future.|

	The Avowed enters the Hedge, either because he failed to resist the pull, 
	or because he went willingly.|

	CtL.340

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------	

@fo me=&COND.HEDGE_DENIZEN [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Hedge Denizen|1|

	Having relied on Goblin Contracts too much or become too reliant on 
	hobgoblin deals, the character becomes a goblin herself. She retains her 
	normal changeling benefits and weaknesses, except in these cases:\%r
	\%b * The changeling's mien warps, growing closer to the appearance she had 
	during her servitude in Arcadia. She has one tell of the player's choice, by 
	which former friends and enemies might recognize her.\%r
	\%b * The Storyteller can no longer spend her Goblin Debt points. The 
	character must work off her debt, per the resolution below.\%r
	\%b * Arcadian Contracts are the birthright of all denizens of Faerie, but 
	the Hedge is its own in-between place. The character can still buy and use 
	Arcadian Contracts, but pays for all of them as if they were in non-favored 
	Regalia and may not circumvent this via Pupil's Devotion.\%r
	\%b * Courts are changeling affairs, and the character no longer is one. The 
	character keeps and can use her old Court Contracts, but cannot purchase new 
	ones. She loses all other benefits of her Court Mantle.\%r
	\%b * Whenever the sun rises over the Hedge, the character can redistribute 
	the set of GoblinContracts she knows across any Goblin Contracts she wants. 
	If she had three Contracts as a changeling, she can pick any three every 
	morning. Purchasing new Goblin Contracts still costs 2 Experiences each.\%r
	\%b * Invoking Goblin Contracts as a Hedge Denizen does not incur Debt.\%r
	\%b * The character can leave the Hedge, but suffers the Deprived Condition 
	until she returns to the Hedge or Arcadia.\%r
	\%b * If the character was mortal, or another nonchangeling unlucky enough to 
	fall in with hobgoblins, she immediately learns three Goblin Contracts of 
	the player's choice. If she is a Storyteller character, the Storyteller may 
	substitute Dread Powers for any of these (p. 253). She can switch them out 
	each dawn as above.\%r
	\%b * The character can make deals, sell Contracts, and collect Debt as a 
	hobgoblin. See p. 256 for details on goblin deals.\%r
	\%b * Changelings with this Condition add one die to Clarity damage rolls.|
	
	(unknown possible sources?)|
	
	The character becomes what she was again, or she embraces her new self to 
	become a Goblin Queen (p. 339).\%r
	\%b * Returning to What Was: The character pays off at least one Goblin Debt 
	point. She cannot simply accept a disadvantage from the Storyteller, or use 
	tokens or other shortcuts to lose Debt points--she's a goblin now, and must 
	pay her Debt by seeking out the goblin with whom she entered into the 
	Contract, or any third party involved if that goblin is dead or otherwise 
	gone, and perform a task at his request. After that, she must heal a point 
	of Clarity damage\\; nonchangelings must gain or lose a dot of Integrity or 
	an equivalent trait. She then becomes her old self again.\%r
	\%b * Any Debt she hasn't worked off yet remains, as do any new Goblin 
	Contracts she learned. If she returns to being mortal, she keeps one Goblin 
	Contract of the player's choice, which she can invoke by taking one point of 
	bashing damage to substitute for each point of Glamour in its cost. Using 
	Goblin Contracts racks up Goblin Debt again.\%r
	\%b * Embracing What Might Be: The changeling suffers two or more Clarity 
	attacks, and takes Clarity damage (or loses an equivalent trait) from at 
	least one. She must also lose one Touchstone, which she can do by simply 
	willing herself to forget it, although losing one in the usual ways counts 
	also. She now resolves the Hedge Denizen Condition, and takes the Goblin 
	Queen Condition instead. Since mortals have no Touchstones, they can't 
	become Goblin Queens.| 
	
	The character works off a point of Goblin Debt but can't, or chooses not to, 
	resolve this Condition via Returning to What Was.|

@fo me=&COND.HUNTED [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Hunted|1|
	
	Someone who poses a serious threat to the character's safety and well-being, 
	physically or emotionally (or both), is after her. For changelings, it's 
	usually an agent of the True Fae, like a Huntsman or loyalist, or perhaps 
	their fetch. Whoever it is might be intent on direct violence, or simply 
	wish to torment her.\%r\%rChangelings with this Condition add one die to 
	Clarity damage rolls.|
	
	(unknown possible sources)|
	
	The character stops her persecutors, either through direct means like 
	violence, or indirect means like changes in lifestyle that deny them access 
	to her or freeing a Huntsman from the True Fae's service.|

	The character's persecutors find her.|
	
	CtL.342

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------	

@fo me=&COND.OATHBREAKER [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Oathbreaker|1|
	
	The character has violated an oath, and receives this Condition in addition 
	to any other effects breaking the oath carries. Changelings instinctively 
	distrust the character. He suffers a -1 on all Social actions with other 
	changelings, and cannot use Glamour to seal their statements. As a known 
	liar, however, he is also immune to having his own statements sealed.\%r\%r
	Changelings with this Condition add one die to Clarity damage rolls.|
	
	Break an oath|
	
	The character undertakes a sincere attempt to make restitution for his 
	betrayal. This includes finding all other participants involved in the oath 
	and undertaking whatever task they assign. It also includes receiving 
	forgiveness from the Wyrd itself\\; this is sure to be the focus of a story, 
	and the particulars are up to the Storyteller.|
	
	Once per session, the player can choose to automatically dramatically fail a

@fo me=&COND.OBLIGED [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Obliged|1|
	
	Your character swore a bargain--not an oath--with a human being. The 
	obligation on her part is probably minor, but she can't let it lapse! Not 
	only would that disappoint the person to whom she gave her word, but it 
	would expose her to the Huntsmen and their Gentry masters.\%r\%r
	While under a bargain, the changeling is more difficult to find. Huntsmen 
	must win a Clash of Wills to use their Hunter's Senses power (p. 266) when 
	tracking the changeling, and fae beings no longer add the changeling's Wyrd 
	in dice to do so when she drops her Mask. In addition, once per chapter, 
	when the changeling is at the site of her obligation (the human's home that 
	she must clean, for example, or in the garden she agreed to tend), she may 
	hide without fear of discovery for the rest of the scene. This benefit 
	applies to any pursuer touched by the Wyrd, be it Huntsman, Gentry, 
	hobgoblin, or even another changeling.|
	
	Make a bargain with a human|
	
	Break the bargain by failing to live up to its terms, or the other party 
	breaks her part of the agreement. Either way, you lose any protections the 
	bargain provided.|
	
	Once per story, gain a Beat when you take a great risk or suffer harm while 
	fulfilling your obligation. You can have help from other characters, but you 
	must be directly involved--no subcontracting out.|

	Your character died because of fae magic while on a sojourn in dreams, or in

	shocked sense of self. Upon gaining this Condition, roll her current 
	Willpower points (not dots) as a dice pool. Ignore 10-again on this roll, 
	and do not roll a chance die if she has no Willpower left. She keeps one 
	Willpower per success, and immediately loses the remainder. While this 
	Condition is in effect, your character does not regain Willpower from 
	Needle, Thread, or equivalent traits. She still regains Willpower from rest, 
	surrender, and other means.|

	experience. She doesn't suffer the untrained penalty for any Subterfuge 
	roll. Take a two-die penalty to Hedgespinning rolls. Until she resolves this

	actions that would reveal her true feelings.|

	The equipment the character is using to aid his action is ready to blow at

	rune, and it's time to duck and cover. A plan may be Volatile because it 
	backfires terribly, or because a Storyteller character betrays the group, 
	etc. Any failure achieved while benefiting from the equipment is 
	automatically a dramatic failure. The equipment may continue to exist after 
	this Condition is resolved, but if so, reduce its equipment bonus by two 
	dice. This can create equipment penalties if the original bonus was fewer 
	than two dice.|

	(Environmental) The area is on fire. Anything flammable is either already

	Effect: All characters suffer a -2 to all rolls due to smoke and heat. After 
	two turns, any character that breathes also suffers 2B per turn due to smoke 
	inhalation. After three turns, the character also suffers 1L per turn from 
	burns and must succeed on a Dexterity + Stamina roll each turn to avoid 
	catching fire (see p. 190).|
	
	Objects or people catching fire and letting it spread can cause this Tilt, 
	as well as supernatural powers or particularly volatile explosions.|
	
	Different types of fire require different methods to extinguish\\; in 
	general, cutting off the fire from its fuel sources does the trick. Water, 
	carbon dioxide, sand, and baking soda can be useful, depending on the size 
	and type of the fire. Eventually all fires burn themselves out, but that can 
	be cold comfort in the aftermath of a destructive blaze.|
