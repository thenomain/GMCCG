Conditions and Tilts for GMC

I'm stealing this from Reno (with permission). 



================================================================================
== CHANGE LOG (oldest last) ====================================================

* removed status logging - needs overhauled/doesn't work
* u( .alert ) -> u( .msg )
* changed some code for Glitch's Muxify system
* logtext() -> u( f.logtext ), removes requirement
* 'this number' divider change: %) -> .
* alert() -> u( .alert )
* added prefixes for Code Object Data Parent

Conditions are tags that affect play for the long-term, from a scene or longer. 
You can gain beats from resolving them or letting them happen, as a reward for 
playing out something difficult.

Tilts are scene-specific tags that do the same thing, but almost never award 
beats. They are effects in a scene or combat.

conds: Current conditions.
tilts: Current tilts.

In all cases, 'cond' and 'tilt' run the same code, so wherever you see 'cond' 
you can substitute it for 'tilt'. In all cases, <name> is the name of the 
condition or tilt.

cond
    List your current conditions/tilts, with number and title.
cond <num>
    List details about one of your conditions/tilts.
cond/show <num>=<list,of,targets>
    Show details about one of your conditions/tilts to other people.

cond <name>

-- Conditions ------------------------------------------------------------------
*/

&COND.ADDICTED [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Addicted|1|

	Your character is addicted to something, whether drugs, gambling or other 
	destructive behaviors. Some addictions are more dangerous than others, but 
	the nature of addiction is that it slowly takes over your life, impeding 
	functionality. If you are addicted, you need to indulge your addiction 
	regularly to keep it under control. A specific addiction should be chosen 
	upon taking this Condition; characters can take this Condition multiple 
	times for different addictions. Being unable to feed your addiction can 
	result in the Deprived Condition (see below).|

	Alcoholism, substance abuse, Vitae Addiction.|

	Regain a dot of Integrity, lose another dot of Integrity, or achieve an 
	exceptional success on a breaking point.|

	Your character chooses to get a fix rather than fulfill an obligation.|

	GMC.181,B&S.302

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

&COND.AMNESIA [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Amnesia|1|

	Your character is missing a portion of her memory. An entire period of her 
	life is just gone. This causes massive difficulties with friends and loved 
	ones.|

	Physical or psychological trauma, the Dominate Discipline.|

	You regain your memory and learn the truth. Depending on the circumstances, 
	this may constitute a breaking point at a level determined by the 
	Storyteller.|

	Something problematic arises, such as a forgotten arrest warrant or old 
	enemy.|

	GMC.181,B&S.302

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

&COND.BESTIAL [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Bestial|0|

	Your character acts on primal, physical impulses. Frightening things make 
	him run. He meets aggressive threats with violence and anger. Take a 2 die 
	penalty to all rolls to resist frenzy or physical impulse. As well, take a 2 
	die penalty to Defense due to impulsive action. Any rolls to compel your 
	character to impulsive, aggressive action or escape achieve exceptional 
	success on three successes instead of five. This could apply to Disciplines 
	such as Nightmare, or Dominate under the right circumstances. This Condition 
	fades naturally after a number of nights equal to the Blood Potency of the 
	vampire who caused it. In the case of the predatory aura, this is the 
	vampire who won the conflict. In the case of testing for detachment, this is 
	the vampires own Blood Potency. After resolving Bestial, your character 
	cannot be subject to this Condition again for a full month.|

	A monstrous predatory aura conflict, facing a breaking point.|

	Cause damage in someones last three Health boxes.|

	n/a|

	B&S.302

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

&COND.BLIND [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Blind|1|

	Your character cannot see. Any rolls requiring sight may only use a chance 
	die. If another sense can be reasonably substituted, make the roll at 3 
	instead. In a combat situation, she suffers the drawbacks of the Blinded 
	Tilt (see p. 208). This Condition may be temporary, but that is usually the 
	result of a combat effect, in which case the Blindness Tilt would apply.|

	|

	Your character regains her sight.|

	Your character encounters a limitation or difficulty that inconveniences 
	her.|

	GMC.181

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

&COND.BROKEN [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Broken|1|

	Whatever you did or saw, something inside you snapped. You can barely muster 
	up the will to do your job anymore, and anything more emotionally intense 
	than a raised voice makes you flinch and back down. Apply a 2 die penalty to 
	all Social rolls and rolls involving Resolve, and a 5 die penalty to all use 
	of the Intimidation Skill.|

	Tremendous psychological trauma, the Nightmare Discipline, some Ghoul 
	Merits.|

	Regain a dot of Integrity, lose another dot of Integrity, or achieve an 
	exceptional success on a breaking point.|

	You back down from a confrontation or fail a roll due to this Condition.|

	GMC.181,B&S.302

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

&COND.BONDED [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Bonded|0|

	Your character has established an extensive bond with a specific animal. She 
	gains +2 on any rolls to influence or persuade her bonded animal. It may add 
	your Animal Ken to any rolls to resist coercion or fear when in your 
	characters presence. The animal may add your characters Animal Ken to any 
	one die roll. |

	|

	The bonded animal dies or is otherwise parted from the character.|

	n/a|

	GMC.181

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

&COND.CHARMED [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Charmed|1|

	Youve been charmed by a vampires supernatural force of personality. You dont 
	want to believe that anything he says is a lie, and you cant read his true 
	intentions. The vampire adds his Majesty dots to Manipulation rolls against 
	you, and any Wits + Empathy or Subterfuge rolls you make to detect his lies 
	or uncover his true motives suffer a penalty equal to his Majesty dots. 
	Using supernatural means to detect his lies become a Clash of Wills. You 
	want to do things for the vampire, to make him happy. If he asks, youll do 
	favors for him like he was one of your best friends giving him a place to 
	crash, lending him your car keys, or revealing secrets that you really

	You'll happily take actions that threaten your own life ramming a speeding 
	truck head-on, jumping in front of a gun-wielding psycho, or handing over 
	your spouse and children for the vampire to play with. The compulsion lasts 
	for one night for each dot of the vampires Blood Potency. You need to spend 
	a point of Willpower just to take an action that goes against your masters

	of your fist crawling up your leg. Whatever the case, you need to leave

	someone tries to stop you from escaping, youll fight your way past them. You 
	cant approach the source of your fear or act against it and if the only way 
	out involves going near the source of your fear, youll collapse on the 
	ground in terror. Supernatural creatures prone to loss of control, including

	her commands, but she can just Mesmerize you and order you that way. She 
	still needs to use Dominate to alter your memory. This Condition fades

&COND.SWOONING [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Swooning|0|

	Your character is attracted to someone and is vulnerable where they are 
	concerned. He may have the proverbial butterflies in his stomach or just be 
	constantly aware of the object of his affection. A character may have 
	multiple instances of this Condition, reflecting affection for multiple

	affect the specified character, who also gains +2 die bonus on any Social 
	rolls against him. If the specified character is attempting Social 
	maneuvering on the Swooning character, the impression level is considered

	Your character committed diablerie, and now retains traces of her victims

&TILT.ARM_WRACK [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Arm Wrack|0|

	Your arm burns with pain and then goes numb. It could be dislocated, 
	sprained, or broken: whatevers wrong with it, you cant move your limb. 
	%rEffect: If your arms broken or otherwise busted, you drop whatever youre 
	holding in that arm and cant use it to attack opponents unless youve got the 
	Ambidextrous Merit, you suffer off-hand penalties for any rolls that require 
	manual dexterity. If this effect spreads to both limbs, youre down to a 
	chance die on any rolls that require manual dexterity, and -3 to all other 
	Physical actions. |

	Some supernatural powers can cripple a victims limbs or break bones with a 
	touch. A character can have his arm knocked out by a targeted blow to the 
	arm (2 penalty) that deals more damage than the characters Stamina. A 
	targeted blow to the hand inflicts this Tilt if it does any damage.|

	If the Tilt is inflicted as a result of an attack, mark an x under the 
	leftmost Health box inflicted in that attack; the Tilt ends when the damage 
	that caused it has healed. If aggravated damage inflicts this Tilt, the 
	character loses the use of his arm (or straight up loses his arm)

&TILT.BEATEN_DOWN [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Beaten Down|0|

	The character has had the fight knocked out of him.%rEffect: The character 
	cannot take active part in the fight without extra effort. The player must 
	spend a point of Willpower each timehe wants the character to take a violent 
	action in the fight. He can still run, Dodge, and apply Defense. If he 
	wishes to take another action, the Storyteller should judge whether the 
	action is aggressive enough to require the expenditure.|

	The character suffers bashing damage in excess of his Stamina orany amount 
	of lethal damage. |

	The character surrenders and gives the aggressor what he wants. At this 
	point, the character regains a point of Willpower and takes a Beat, but can 
	take no further action in the fight. If the aggressors intent is to kill or 
	injure the character, obviously surrender isnt a good option.|

&TILT.BLINDED [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Blinded|0|

	The characters eyes are damaged or removed, or the character is placed in a 
	situation where eyesight is eliminated (a pitch-black room or a supernatural 
	effect).%rEffect: The character suffers a -3 penalty to any rolls that rely 
	on vision including attack rolls and halves his Defense if one eye is 
	blinded. That penalty increases to -5 and losing all Defense if both eyes 
	are affected.|

	The most common means of inflicting the tilt is to severely impair the 
	targets eyesight (using a blindfold, etc). An attacker can inflict temporary 
	blindness by slashing at her opponents brow, throwing sand into his eyes, or 
	kicking up dirt. This requires an attack roll of Dexterity + Athletics with 
	a -3 penalty; the victims Defense applies to this attack. If it succeeds, 
	the target is Blinded for the next turn. Blindness can also be inflicted by 
	dealing damage to the targets eyes a specified attack with a -5 penalty (see 
	Specified Targets, above). A successful attack normally damages one eye. It 
	takes an exceptional success to totally blind an attacker. |

	If an attack against the characters eye does any points of damage, mark an x 
	under the leftmost Health box inflicted in that attack. If the damage 
	inflicted is aggravated the character loses vision in that eye permanently. 
	Otherwise, the condition ends when the damage that caused the Tilt is 
	healed.|

&TILT.BLIZZARD [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Blizzard|0|

	(Environmental) Heavy snowfall carpets the ground and just keeps falling, 
	whipped up by howling winds into a barrage of whirling white.%r
	%rEffect: Blizzards make it very hard to see for any real distance. Rolls to 
	see things close to the characters person, out to arms length away, suffer a 
	-1 penalty. Each additional ten yards inflicts an additional -1 penalty 
	(cumulative) on all visual Perception rolls. This penalty also applies to 
	ranged attack rolls. Moving through snow is difficult. Every four inches of 
	snow applies a -1 penalty to appropriate Physical rolls, including combat 
	rolls, Athletics, and so forth. The Blizzard Tilt rarely applies by itself 
	the Storyteller may also inflict any or all of the Extreme Cold, Heavy 
	Winds, or Ice Tilts (all found below).|

	For the most part, the weather is out of the characters control the 
	Storyteller should telegraph an incoming blizzard before it hits, but its 
	ultimately up to her. Some supernatural powers might grant a character the 
	power to create a blizzard.|

	Without supernatural powers, characters cant end a blizzard. The best they 
	can manage is to escape the weather or wait for it to stop. Proper equipment 
	(such as goggles and snow boots) can add +1 to +3 to a roll, offsetting some 
	of the penalties. If someone is causing this Tilt through a supernatural 
	power, its possible that the characters could disrupt his concentration.|

	GMC.208

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

&TILT.DEAFENED [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Deafened|0|

	The character cant hear. Maybe hes suffering intense tinnitus or can only 
	hear the roaring of blood in his ears, or he just plain cant hear.%rEffect: 
	If the character is deaf in one ear, he suffers a -3 penalty to 
	hearing-based Perception rolls. A character who is struck deaf in both ears 
	only gets a chance die on hearing-based Perception rolls, and suffers a -2 
	penalty to all combat-related dice rolls suddenly losing the ability to hear 
	the people around you is tremendously disorienting.|

	A particularly loud noise within 10 feet of the character may cause 
	temporary hearing loss as though the character were deaf in both ears. 
	Alternatively, a targeted attack on the ear at a -4 penalty can deafen a 
	character. Supernatural creatures with heightened senses can be deafened by 
	loud noises at greater distances.|

	Deafness from loud noises fades after 10 (victims Stamina + Resolve) turns. 
	If an attack against the characters ear does any points of damage, mark an x 
	under the leftmost Health box inflicted in that attack. If the damage 
	inflicted is aggravated, the character loses hearing in the ear permanently. 
	Otherwise, the condition ends when the damage that caused the Tilt is 
	healed.|

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

&TILT.DRUGGED [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Drugged|0|

	The characters mind is addled by mind-altering substances, such as drink or 
	drugs.%rEffect: The effects of specific drugs are detailed in the on p.177 
	of the World of Darkness Rulebook. A generic narcotic can be represented 
	with one set of modifiers: the character suffers a -2 modifier to Speed (and 
	static Defense, if used) and a -3 penalty to all rolls in combat, including 
	Defense and Perception. The character also ignores wound penalties.|

	If the character has chosen to take drugs, then he suffers the effects. To 
	administer drugs to another character is a Dexterity + Weaponry attack, 
	suffering a -1 modifier for the improvised weapon. If the drug has to go in 
	to a specific body part (such as an arm or mouth), it requires an attack 
	against a specified target.|

	Each drug in the World of Darkness Rulebookexplains how long a high lasts. A 
	generic narcotic lasts for 10 (victims Stamina + Resolve) hours. This time 
	is halved by medical help, such as pumping the victims stomach or flushing 
	his system.|

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

&TILT.EARTHQUAKE [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Earthquake|0|

	(Environmental) Everything shudders and shakes; huge rents and holes tear 
	the ground wide open.%rEffect: Earthquakes dont last long, but they dont 
	have to. When the quakes actually occurring, all Dexterity-based dice pools 
	(and Defense) suffer a -1 to -5 penalty depending on the quakes severity. 
	Characters take between one and three points of lethal damage per turn of 
	the quakes duration, though a reflexive Stamina + Athletics roll can 
	downgrade that damage to bashing or cancel it entirely on an exceptional 
	success.|

	Without tremendous supernatural power, its almost impossible to cause an 
	earthquake. A character who detonates a powerful explosive underground might 
	simulate the effects over a city-block for a few seconds.|

	Earthquakes are fortunately very quick events. Its very rare for one to last 
	more than a minute (20 turns), so waiting them out is the best course of 
	action.|

	GMC.208

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

&TILT.EXTREME_COLD [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Extreme Cold|0|

	(Environmental) Bone-chilling winds bite through the character, or trudging 
	through knee-deep snow takes all of the sensation from his limbs. Any time 
	the temperature gets down below zero degrees Celsius (32 degrees 
	Fahrenheit), a character can suffer from the colds effects. This Tilt can 
	sometimes be personal, either as a result of a medical condition such as 
	hypothermia or a supernatural power.%rEffect: When the temperature is below 
	freezing, characters cant heal bashing damage the extreme temperature deals 
	damage at the same rate normal characters heal it (a cut might turn to 
	frostbite, for instance). Supernatural beings and characters who heal faster 
	than normal instead halve their normal healing rate. For every hour that a 
	character is continuously affected by this Tilt, he accrues a -1 penalty to 
	all rolls. When that penalty hits -5 dice, he instead suffers 1 point of 
	lethal damage per hour.|

	A character can suffer this Tilt from being in a frozen environment whether 
	he's outside in the Arctic tundra or in a walk-in freezer. Inflicting the 
	Tilt is reasonably straightforward: throw the victim into a freezing lake or 
	lock him in a freezer for long enough and hell develop hypothermia.|

	The best way to escape the freezing cold is to find a source of warmth 
	either a building with working heating, or warm bundled clothing. A 
	character who has hypothermia requires medical attention.|

	GMC.209

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

&TILT.EXTREME_HEAT [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Extreme Heat|0|

	(Environmental) The character might be stumbling through the desert with the 
	sun beating down on him, or running through the steam-tunnels surrounding an 
	old boiler room. This Tilt can also be personal, the result of a 
	debilitating fever that spikes his temperature far above the norm. Extreme 
	heat is normally anything above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) 
	this includes both environmental temperature and internal body temperature 
	due to fever.%rEffect: When the temperature is far above normal, characters 
	can't heal bashing damage the extreme temperature deals damage at the same 
	rate normal characters heal it (a cut might heal, but its replaced by 
	sunburn or sunstroke). Supernatural beings and characters who heal faster 
	than normal instead halve their normal healing rate. For every hour that a 
	character is continuously affected by this Tilt, he accrues a -1 penalty to 
	all rolls. When that penalty hits -5 dice, he instead suffers a point of 
	lethal damage per hour.|

	This Tilt is usually caused by environmental factors being out at noon in 
	the desert or spending too long in a sauna or forge. Even a fever is the 
	result of an infection, rather than something that an opponent can force on 
	a character. Its possible to create this Tilt on a given character: securing 
	someone to a chair right next to an old, inefficient boiler, or stranding 
	them in the desert far from any shade.|

	The key to ending this Tilt is simple: get out of the heat. In a desert or 
	similar environment, finding shade is paramount. Elsewhere, the character 
	needs to escape whatever is causing the abnormal temperatures.|

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

&TILT.FLOODED [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Flooded|0|

	(Environmental) Some liquid brackish water, mud, gore, or raw sewage is high 
	enough to impede the characters progress.%rEffect: Each foot of liquid 
	inflicts a -2 penalty to all Physical dice pools. If the water goes up over 
	her head, a character has to swim (Dexterity + Athletics) with a penalty 
	appropriate for the speed of flooding. Alternatively, she can try to hold 
	her breath (Holding Breath, p. 49 of the World of Darkness Rulebook) if she 
	cannot get her head above the rising waters.|

	Normally, this Tilt is the result of heavy rain, sudden snowmelt, or a 
	broken water main. Characters can cause this Tilt by smashing up a water 
	heater or blowing up a small dam. Some supernatural creatures may be able to 
	call floods down onto a region.|

	Characters can escape flooding by getting to high ground, which is enough to 
	mitigate this Tilt. A long-term fix would require draining the floodwaters, 
	but each flood requires its own solution.|

	GMC.209

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

&TILT.HEAVY_RAIN [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Heavy Rain|0|

	(Environmental) Torrential rain lashes down in knives, bouncing high off the 
	sidewalk. The sound of rain on the ground is a constant hammering rumble 
	that goes on without end, like dropping ball bearings on a tin roof. Thick 
	gray curtains of water obscure vision.%rEffect: Heavy rains approaching 
	tropical storm levels or worse cause a Perception penalty of -3 dice to both 
	vision and hearing. Rains hard to see through, but its also loud. If the 
	rains carry on for an hour or more, the Flooded Tilt will soon follow. This 
	Tilt is often accompanied by Heavy Winds; a character trapped out in Heavy 
	Rains might come under the effects of Extreme Cold.|

	Short of supernatural power or a fleet of cloud-seeding aircraft, Heavy Rain 
	is the result of natural weather patterns.|

	The best way out of the rain is to get indoors. Unless its the start of some 
	sodden apocalypse, the characters can wait for the weather to ease.|

	|

	GMC.209

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

&TILT.HEAVY_WINDS [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Heavy Winds|0|

	(Environmental) Howling winds buffet at the characters, whipping street 
	furniture into the air, tearing the roofs from buildings. Powerful winds can 
	toss cars around like toys. Anyone out in the winds feels like theyre taking 
	a beating just for walking down the street.%rEffect: Heavy winds are loud, 
	so characters suffer a -3 modifier to aural Perception rolls. Also the wind 
	inflicts a penalty to all Physical rolls when out in the winds including 
	Drive rolls. Grade the wind from one to five one is tropical storm level 
	(around 40 MPH), three is hurricane level (around 80 MPH), and five is 
	tornado level (150+ MPH). This is the penalty applied to Physical dice 
	rolls. Characters outside in the maelstrom take damage from flying debris, 
	taking bashing damage each turn equal to the winds rating. Characters can 
	make a reflexive Dexterity + Athletics roll to avoid damage.|

	Heavy winds are a fact of life, from siroccos in the desert to tornados in 
	the Midwest to wind shears everywhere.|

	Getting out of the wind is the best way to end this Tilt. Sometimes thats as 
	easy as sheltering in an automobile as long as nobody tries to drive. 
	Buildings provide more permanent shelter.|

	|

	GMC.209

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

&TILT.ICE [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Ice|0|

	(Environmental) The grounds covered in a mirror-smooth layer of ice that 
	sends wheels spinning and peoples feet flying out from under them. The ice 
	could be so thin as to be nearly invisible or a thick layer thats the only 
	thing keeping the characters from sinking into a frozen lake.%rEffect: When 
	a character cant trust her footing, divide her Speed in half and all 
	Physical rolls (and Defense) suffer a -2 penalty. Attempting to move at full 
	Speed increases the Physical penalty to -4. Any dramatic failure on a 
	Physical roll inflicts the Knocked Down Tilt. Driving on ice is a real pain 
	halve Acceleration and characters suffer a -5 penalty to Drive rolls.|

	This Tilt doesnt just apply to icy conditions, but to any surface thats 
	slick and slippery, including a spill of industrial lubricant or just a 
	really well polished wooden or linoleum floor. Characters can use a 
	Dexterity + Crafts roll to cover an area in industrial cleaner or mix up 
	cleaning chemicals into a lubricant. If the Extreme Cold Tilt is in effect, 
	even covering the area with water would do the trick.|

	Get off the ice is good advice, but that can take work. Characters can use 
	heat or fire to melt ice, or throw down copious quantities of salt or grit 
	to increase traction.|

	GMC.210

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

&TILT.IMMOBILIZED [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Immobilized|0|

	Something holds the character fast, preventing him from moving. This could 
	be a grappling opponent, a straightjacket wrapped with heavy chains, or a 
	coffin secured on the outside with a padlock.%rEffect: The character cant do 
	anything but wriggle helplessly. He cant apply Defense against incoming 
	attacks and cant take combat-related actions. If someones holding him down, 
	he can spend a point of Willpower to deliver a head-butt or similar attack, 
	but even that might not free him.|

	The usual way to inflict this Tilt is through the Restrain grappling move. 
	This often uses material means to prevent the victim from moving, such as 
	binding limbs with duct tape or zip-ties, tossing the victim into a car 
	trunk or similar tight space, or applying painful holds and joint locks.|

	An Immobilized target can break free by escaping from a grapple or snapping 
	whatever binds her. If grappled, the character can struggle as normal but 
	can only select the Break Free move on a success. If held by an item, the 
	character must make a Strength + Athletics roll penalized by the items 
	Durability. If a characters arms and legs are both bound, he suffers a -2 
	penalty; this increases to -4 if hes hog-tied. On a success, he snaps the 
	bindings or breaks free. Each roll, successful or not, deals a point of 
	bashing damage.|

	|

	GMC.210

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

&TILT.INSANE [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Insane|0|

	The character suffers from a panic attack, sudden imbalance, or a full-on 
	psychotic break. Her pulse races and her mind cannot focus. The worlds an 
	unstable place, and shes unable to keep her balance.%rEffect: Someone 
	suffering a psychotic break isnt the sort of person to go down without a 
	fight. Her stated intent might be irrational or just plain impossible, and 
	she might have fewer ethical problems with using extreme violence to get 
	what she wants. The character gains a +1 bonus to all combat rolls, but 
	takes actions after everyone else (if two characters suffer from the Insane 
	Tilt, both act after everyone else but compare Initiative as normal). A 
	character suffering from this Tilt may spend Willpower, but the cost is 2 
	dots instead of 1 for the same effect. |

	Faced with extraordinary circumstances, any character with an appropriate 
	Condition may gain the Insane Tilt. The Storyteller can call for a Resolve + 
	Composure roll to resist a general anxiety that gnaws at the characters 
	mind; if the character fails, he gains the Tilt. If the character witnesses 
	something truly horrific a daughter watches her father walk to the end of 
	the garden and shoot himself in the head, smiling all the while; a man 
	stumbles into the wrong office at work and sees his co-workers feasting on 
	the interns organs; a solder sees her unit gunned down by a sniper while she 
	can do nothing the Storyteller can rule that the Tilt is unavoidable. The 
	Insane Tilt can also be triggered by a breaking point. If a character fails 
	a breaking point role during combat, the Storyteller may apply the Insane 
	Tilt then as well. A character can work to inspireanother characters madness 
	in order to cause this Tilt. She could orchestrate events that she hopes 
	will provoke a psychotic break, but thats amateur hour. A professional swaps 
	out her victims meds, giving stimulants just as his bipolar cycle ticks into 
	mania, or dosing a paranoid or schizophrenic with hallucinogenic drugs. Some 
	supernatural creatures possess mind-affecting powers that can apply this 
	Tilt, even to characters who do not have an appropriate Condition.|

	The specific effects of this Tilt dont normally last beyond the end of the 
	scene. A character can try to force her mind to a state of balance, but its 
	not easy. She must sit and focus on blocking out the craziness. She rolls 
	Resolve + Composure as an instant action contested by a dice pool of (10 her 
	Willpower). She cant take any other actions that turn and doesnt apply 
	Defense against any attacks.|

&TILT.INSENSATE [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Insensate|0|

	The character shuts down, either due to extreme fear or sudden pleasure. He 
	may huddle in a corner, cringe away from sudden noises, or stare into space 
	as waves of pleasure lap over him.%rEffect: The character cant take any 
	actions until the Tilt is resolved. He can apply Defense to incoming 
	attacks, and if he takes any damage from an attack, hes knocked free of 
	whatever fogged his brain.|

	Several supernatural powers can leave their victim in a trance-like state of 
	heightened emotion, whether its a vampires mind-affecting tricks or the 
	pants-shitting terror of witnessing a werewolf take on an inhuman form. A 
	truly heroic amount of alcohol or a hallucinogenic drug might have similar 
	effects; administering such a drug is a Dexterity + Weaponry attack, 
	suffering a -1 modifier for the improvised weapon.|

	The Tilt wears off at the end of the scene. The victim can spend a point of 
	Willpower before then to act normally for one turn. A successful attack will 
	also end the Tilt. If a character has been knocked insensible by drugs, this 
	Tilt is replaced with the Drugged Tilt when it ends.|

&TILT.KNOCKED_DOWN [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Knocked Down|0|

	Something knocks the character to the floor, either toppling her with a 
	powerful blow to the chest or taking one of her legs out from under her.
	%rEffect: The character is knocked off her feet. If she hasnt already acted 
	this turn, she loses her action. Once shes on the ground, a character is 
	considered prone (see Going Prone, pp. 164165 of the World of Darkness 
	Rulebook). The character can still apply Defense against incoming attacks, 
	and can attempt to attack from the ground at a -2 penalty.|

	Some weapons list Knockdown as a special effect of a damaging hit. 
	Otherwise, a melee weapon with a damage modifier of +2 or greater, or a 
	firearm with a damage modifier of +3 or more can be used to knock a 
	character down with the force of the blow. Alternatively, a melee weapon or 
	unarmed attack can knock an opponent down with a targeted attack against the 
	legs (2 modifier). The attacker declares that he wants to knock his opponent 
	down and halves the total damage done (rounding down). On a successful 
	attack, the target is knocked down.|

	The easiest way to end this Tilt is to stand up, which takes an action. A 
	character affected by this Tilt who hasnt yet acted can make a Dexterity + 
	Athletics roll, minus any weapon modifier, instead of her normal action. If 
	successful, she avoids the effects of this Tilt altogether. On a failure, 
	she falls over and the Tilt applies as normal.|

&TILT.LEG_WRACK [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Leg Wrack|0|

	Your leg feels like its going to snap clean off whenever you move; when you 
	stop moving, you feel a burning numbness that encourages you to avoid 
	moving.%rEffect: If your leg is broken, sprained, or dislocated, halve your 
	Speed and suffer a -2 penalty on Physical rolls that require movement (and 
	Defense). If both of your legs are wracked, you fall over taking the Knocked 
	Down Tilt and cannot get up. Your Speed is reduced to 1; if you want to move 
	at all, you cannot take any other action. Physical rolls that require 
	movement are reduced to a chance die.|

	Some supernatural powers can cripple a victims limbs or break bone with a 
	touch. A character can have his leg knocked out by a targeted blow to the 
	leg (2 penalty) that deals more damage than the characters Stamina.|

	If the Tilt is inflicted as a result of an attack, mark an x under the 
	leftmost Health box inflicted in that attack. The Tilt ends when that damage 
	that caused it has healed. If the damage that inflicts this Tilt is 
	aggravated, the character loses use of his leg permanently.|

&TILT.POISONED [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Poisoned|0|

	Youve got poison inside you. Its tearing you apart from the inside; burning 
	like acid in your gut and making your head swim.%rEffect: This Tilt applies 
	a general sense of being poisoned to a character without worrying about 
	Toxicity during combat. For the purposes of this Tilt, a poison is either 
	moderate or grave a moderate poison causes 1 point of bashing damage per 
	turn of combat, while a grave poison ups that to 1 point of lethal damage 
	per turn. If the Storyteller cares to continue the effects of the poison 
	outside of combat, he can apply the standard rules for handling poisons and 
	toxins when combat is complete.|

	Its possible for a character to not know that hes been poisoned. It could be 
	as innocuous as switching drinks with a pretty girl who is the target of a 
	mob hit, or as simple as walking into a house with a carbon monoxide leak. 
	That said, the main time poison comes up in combat is when one combatant 
	inflicts it on another. Injecting your opponent with a syringe full of drain 
	cleaner or snake venom is a Dexterity + Weaponry attack, suffering a -1 
	modifier for the improvised weapon.|

	Short of immediate medical attention and how many fights take place in an 
	emergency room? all a victim can do is struggle on. Roll Stamina + Resolve 
	as a reflexive action each turn that your character is poisoned. If your 
	character intends to act (meaning, takes a non-reflexive action), the roll 
	suffers a -3 penalty. Success counteracts the damage for one turn only.|

&TILT.SICK [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Sick|0|

	Your stomach churns. You retch and heave but only succeed in bringing up 
	bile. Sweat beads on your brow as you spike a fever. Your muscles ache with 
	every movement. Youre wracked with hot and cold flushes as a sickness gnaws 
	away at your insides.%rEffect: This Tilt applies a general sickness to a 
	character without worrying about the specific illness. For the purposes of 
	this Tilt, a sickness is either moderate or grave. A moderate sickness, such 
	as a cold, asthma, the flu, or just a bad hangover, causes a -1 penalty to 
	all actions during combat. That penalty increases by one every two turns 
	(the first two turns, the character suffers a -1 penalty, the next two turns 
	the penalty is -2, and so on up to a maximum of -5 dice on turn 9). A grave 
	sickness, such as pneumonia, heavy metal poisoning, or aggressive cancer, 
	inflicts the same dice pool penalties as a mild sickness. In addition, 
	however, the physical stress of fighting or even defending oneself from an 
	attacker while gravely ill inflicts 1 point of bashing damage per turn of 
	combat.|

	Its not easy to deliberately make someone sick. Sure, if you can get your 
	hands on a vial of smallpox or deliberately use a disease youve got to make 
	someone sick (a breaking point, especially in the case of grave diseases 
	like AIDS), then youve got a reasonable chance. Some supernatural creatures 
	have abilities that can inflict diseases on others. Aside from that, youve 
	just got to expose your opponent to the sickness long before you fight and 
	hope for the best.|

	This Tilt reflects the effects of sickness as it specifically applies to 
	combat. Outside of combat, use the existing system for diseases (World of 
	Darkness Rulebook, p. 176). The penalties inflicted by this Tilt fade at a 
	rate of one point per turn once the character has a chance to rest, but any 
	damage inflicted remains until the character can heal.|

&TILT.STUNNED [v( d.ctdb )]=
	Stunned|0|

	Your character is dazed and unable to think straight. Maybe her vision 
	blurs. If shes stunned as a result of a blow to the head, shes probably got 
	a concussion.%rEffect: A character with the Stunned Tilt loses her next 
	action, and halves her Defense until she can next act.|

	A character can be stunned by any attack that does at least as much damage 
	as her Size in a single hit. Some weapons have a stun special ability. These 
	double the weapon modifier only for the purposes of determining whether the 
	attacker inflicts the Stunned Tilt. Attacks against the targets head (see 
	Specified Targets, p. 203) count the characters Size as one lower for the 
	purposes of this Tilt. The Storyteller might determine that additional 
	effects cause this Tilt, like being caught in the blast area of an explosion 
	(World of Darkness Rulebook, p. 178).|

	The effects of this Tilt normally only last for a single turn. The character 
	can end the Tilt during her own action by reflexively spending a point of 
	Willpower to gather her wits, though she suffers a 3 modifier to any actions 
	she takes that turn.|
